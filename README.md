# gromit and martinate

Auxiliary tools for automated atomistic (gromit) and coarse-grained (martinate) molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS

## Synopsis

Molecular dynamics simulations have complex workflows, including the generation of a model, setting up the environment, relaxation of the system and finally the production simulation. Despite the intrinsic complexity, the steps of 
the process are well-defined. For simulations of protein and/or DNA in solution, with or without ligand and with or without ions standard protocols are available. Gromit and martinate are versatile wrappers providing such 
protocols for atomistic (gromit) and coarse-grain (martinate) simulations, using the molecular simulation package Gromacs and, for martinate, the coarse grain Martini force field.
